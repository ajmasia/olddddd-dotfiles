# Why this repo exists

I recently decided to make the leap to using linux as my main operating system. One of the advantages of Linux is being able to define and maintain the configuration of the distros you use at all times in order to recover the system or migrate it to another machine without wasting time. For this reason I decided to start working on this repository, to be more and more productive and also to generate knowledge about the creation and maintenance of systems, both for personal and professional use.

# My current machines

Currently I usually use different machines, both for work and for personal use. That is why I decided to organize the different configurations around them, since you could use different distros for each of them with different configurations even per user.

- [Slimbook ProX AMD](https://slimbook.es/en/pro-x-en#info) for dev. This is the machine that I usually use 100% for software development at [Genially](https://genial.ly/). You can see my current confgs [here](./slimbook-prox).
- [MacBook Pro Retina 15-inch, late 2013](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP690?locale=es_ES), currently using [macOS Catalina 10.15.7](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP803?locale=es_ES) for my personal use.

# Directory structure

- `/commons` contains all possible shared configs.
- `/macos` contains my MacOS configs.
- `/nixos` contains my NixOS configuration for work
- `/wallpapers` contains my favourite wallpapers

# Todo

- [ ] Clean my old configs repositories
- [ ] Add my Macbook Pro machine configs
- [ ] Document my current configs

I hope to continue learning every day and share the results in the different configurations that I am testing. And remember, this repo is always in progress ðŸ˜„

Enyoy! ðŸš€ðŸ˜„
